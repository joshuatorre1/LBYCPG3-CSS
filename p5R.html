                    <li>You can perform activities throughout the day which can be used to: boost stats, increase Confidant relationships, or gather materials for your next exploration</li><br> <!-- COMMENT: Insert how to play instructions inside list tags. Add list tags if needed. -->
					<li>Boosting stats is important as these stats (Knowledge, Guts, Charm, Proficiency, and Kindness) will impact your ability to do certain things</li><br>
					<li>Increase your relationships with Confidants as it affects: your ability to create Personas, a character's passive abilities in combat, and options for romance</li><br>
                    <li>The combat is turn based with the order being determined by the Speed attribute of the characters and enemies. Each character has a melee attack, gun attack, and Persona skills which vary from one another</li><br> <!-- COMMENT: Insert how to play instructions inside list tags. Add list tags if needed. -->
                    <li>Only the protagonist has the ability to gain, fuse, and switch Personas. Personas can be gained throughout the story and can be upgraded and fused in the Velvet Room</li><br> <!-- COMMENT: Insert how to play instructions inside list tags. Add list tags if needed. -->
					<li>For each Palace, there is a deadline for the latest it can be tackled. Failure to steal the treasure before then results in a game over.</li><br>
					<li>Requests are obtained through either the Phansite or Mishima. These requests have you go into Mementos to track down Shadows who are causing people problems but are not distorted enough to create a Palace</li><br>
