He has spent much of his time involved with combat and weapons, having worked for the French military before becoming a PMC marksman and then a weapons designer for Kingdom Defense. His employment at Kingdom was only a stepping stone for him though, as by this point he was already set on his path in pursuit of his sacred truth.

The radiant Reyna was of particularly high importance to KAY/O for her actions against humanity, and KAY/O was able to eventually eliminate her. However, at this point humans had already suffered severe losses.

A young but former veteran at K/SEC, she was recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as part of their Omega Project, specifically to utilize her electric abilities as they attempted to power an Alpha-Omega teleporter. Accepting a position there as their nineteenth agent, "Neon", Valdez left her home to join the Protocol and now seeks to help establish a stable connection that will finally allow the VP to cross over to Earth-2.

All he knows that links to who he used to be is a place known as Point Light, a past friendship with Sabine "Viper" Callas, and feelings of restoration with every kill he makes. Contributing to the formation of the VALORANT Protocol, Omen would go on to become it's third recruit and serve as one of its more experienced agents, all while he continues his search for answers about what truly happened to him over a decade ago.

                        Hailing from the town of Severomorsk, in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, Sasha Novikov is an archer who became an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as its sixth recruit, "Sova". As an agent, Sova primarily served as the team's scout, gathering information and searching for targets using olden methods should technology come up short. His capabilities in the field earned him a reputation of being the most trusted man of the Protocol's commander, Brimstone.

                        Sabine Callas hails from the United States, with possible links to Seattle. Holding a doctorate and awards such as the R. Francis Prize and the Denton Outstanding Innovation Award, her previous occupations include roles with Kingdom Corporation, eventually becoming its first Chief Scientific Officer on the board of advisors, and influence over the conglomerate's ventures in Rabat, Morocco. It has also been suggested by her fellow agents that she used to be some sort of healer. At some point during her time at Kingdom however, there was an "incident".

                    <p>
                        A radiant from Tokyo, Japan, Ryo Kiritani is a man dedicated to uncovering his past. Specifically interested in his ancestors and an ancient order of samurai, Kiritani's search has kept on bringing him to Kingdom's S22 container port. On his first visit, he broke into the facility and stole a mask from a set of samurai armor that allowed him to see into another dimension. He was later recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as its fifteenth agent, "Yoru".

                <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Straight from the files of Brimstone, this is the VALORANT Beginner’s Guide. Whether this is your first rotation or you're needing a refresher, we figure it’s best you take it from the Agent who’s seen it all before. Below is what to know before your first game. Pay attention. Might learn something.</li><br>
                    <li>Before you enter your first round, you get to pick from a group of Agents, each with their own role and special skills designed to work alongside each other toward a win. You can dig into the specifics of each Agent on our Agents page.</li><br>
                    <li>After everyone selects their Agent (oh, you picked that one), you’ll jump into a random map and formally enter the first round.</li><br>
                    <li>Start a round as either attacker or defender and switch sides in between. Before you do either, you’ll need to navigate the buy phase, which lets you purchase weapons and abilities. What you buy shapes how you can win. Let style or matchups guide your choices.</li><br>
                    <li>No one’s going to tell you how to spend your money, but you’re going to have to pull the trigger at some point.</li><br>
                    <li>There’s a gun for every situation and you can comb the details of each weapon on our dedicated arsenal page. When in doubt, try buying based on a weapon’s type and see how it fits your style, expertise, and your team’s strategy.</li><br>
                    <li>Each map is a different stage to style on your enemies. Flex your creative skills and savvy gunplay for different encounters.</li><br>
                </ul>
